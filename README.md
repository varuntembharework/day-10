# 📝 To-Do List Manager v5 (Final Day 10)

This is the **final version** of my C++ To-Do List Manager project, built over **Day 6 → Day 10** of my coding journey.  
It is a simple yet powerful **command-line task manager** that supports task creation, editing, searching, completion, deletion, saving, and exporting.

## 🚀 Features
- Add tasks with **title, description, priority, and due date**.
- View tasks in a **clean tabular format**.

- Search tasks by **keyword**.
- Auto-save tasks to a file (`tasks.txt`) and **restore on restart**.
- Detect **overdue tasks** and flag them.
